The code in this folder was used to clean and resample the raw Marsh Harrier date from The Netherlands and Flandres that are stored in the UvA-BiTS database (www.uva-bits.nl) to an hourly resolution. 

We provided the cleaned and resampled tracking data in this Github repository so you do not need to use this code to replicate our analyses. We only provide it as Supplementary Information for the sake of transparancy.
