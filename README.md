# wmh-analysis
## Rationale
This repository contains the R code developped for the research paper on migration patterns of Western Marsh Harriers 
(*'Contrasting migration strategies between nearby breeding populations of Marsh Harrier* Circus aeruginosus 
*using the West African-Eurasian flyway'*) by Wouter Vansteelant et al.

In this paper, GPS tracking data were used to study the wintering migration patterns of *Circus aeruginosus* of 3 breeding populations: 
1. near the Belgian-Dutch border in the provinces East-Flanders (Belgium) and Zeeland (the Netherlands) (4 tracked birds, 
data collection by [INBO](www.inbo.be/en) as part of the Flemish contribution to the [LifeWatch](www.lifewatch.be) observatory), 
2. in the province of Groningen (the Netherlands) (2 tracked birds, data collection by 
[Dutch MontaguÂ´s Harrier Foundation](http://werkgroepgrauwekiekendief.nl/)), and
3. southern Sweden (4 tracked birds, data collection by [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/)).
