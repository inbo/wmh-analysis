# wmh-analysis
## Rationale
This repository contains the R code developped for the research paper on migration patterns of Western Marsh Harriers 
(*'Contrasting migration strategies between nearby breeding populations of Marsh Harrier* Circus aeruginosus 
*using the West African-Eurasian flyway'*) by Wouter Vansteelant et al.

In this paper, GPS tracking data were used to study the wintering migration patterns of *Circus aeruginosus* of 3 breeding populations: 
1. near the Belgian-Dutch border in the provinces East-Flanders (Belgium) and Zeeland (the Netherlands) (4 tracked birds, 
data collection by [INBO](www.inbo.be/en) as part of the Flemish contribution to the [LifeWatch](www.lifewatch.be) observatory), 
2. in the province of Groningen (the Netherlands) (2 tracked birds, data collection by 
[Dutch MontaguÂ´s Harrier Foundation](http://werkgroepgrauwekiekendief.nl/)), and
3. southern Sweden (4 tracked birds, data collection by [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/)).

* ggplot2
* gridExtra
* here
* lattice
* lme4
* lubridate
* maptools
* MASS
* raster
* RColorBrewer

### Data
#### Project data (accessible in this repo)
* annotation.csv: annotated version of the Belgian and Dutch dataset. Wouter Vansteelant determined the start and end dates of migratory and non-migratory periods through expert interpretation of tracks in Google Earth.
    * Bird name [`name`]
	* Migratory cycle [`cycle`] (winter, spring, summer, autumn + year)
	* Starting date [`date`]
    * Behaviour type [`type`] (breeding, dead, migration, move, pre-migration, winter.stage1, winter.stage2, winter.stage3)
    * Criteria for selection in analysis ([`complete`], [`use.date`])
* annotation-swedes.csv: annotated version of the Swedish dataset. Wouter Vansteelant determined the start and end dates of migratory and non-migratory periods through expert interpretation of tracks in Google Earth.
    * Bird name [`name`]
	* Migratory cycle [`cycle`] (winter, spring, summer, autumn + year)
	* Starting date [`date`]
    * Behaviour type [`type`] (breeding, dead, migration, move, pre-migration, winter.stage1, winter.stage2)
    * Criteria for selection in analysis ([`complete`], [`use.date`])
* MH-resampled-23092017.csv: Belgian and Dutch tracking data downloaded from the UvA-BiTS database on September 23rd, 2017
	* Device and individual code ([`dev`], [`name`]
	* Coordinates ([`lat`], [`lon`], [`alt`])
	* Date and time
		* Date time [`dt`]
		* Year [`yr`]
		* [`season`] (spring/autumn)
		* Julian time [`julian`]
		* day of year [`yday`]
	* Data provider [`origin`]
	* Derived codes ([`indday`] (name_julian), [`migr`] (name_yr_season))
	* Calculated parameters using functions in script [`pt2pt_fxns`]
		* Distance [`dist`]
		* Duration [`dur`]
		* Speed ([`spd`] = [`dist`]/[`dur`])		 
* swedes.csv: Swedish tracking data
* weather.csv: daily tailwind conditions calculated using the method of [Klaassen et al. (2010)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-048X.2010.05058.x). u- and v-wind components were obtained from the NOAA NCEP global atmospheric reanalysis model.

#### External GIS data (available through web links)
* ne_50m_admin_0_countries: shapefile containing country boundaries, source: Natural Earth ( https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-cultural-vectors/50m-admin-0-countries-2/)
* alt_30s_bil: raster file containing a DEM of the world, source: worldclim, version 1.4 (http://biogeo.ucdavis.edu/data/climate/worldclim/1_4/grid/cur/alt_30s_bil.zip)

## Scripts
### Main scripts
The scripts are supposed to be run consecutively.
* p2a_analyses_read_processed_data.R: read data files
* p2b_analyses_annotate&clean_processed_data.R: clean data
* p3_Fig1A_Lat-vs-yday.R: make figure 1A of the paper
* p3a_Fig1B&C.R: make figures 1B and 1C
* p3b_FigS2_Wintering-fin.R: make figure S2
* p4_wind-fin.R: read wind data and calculate mean daily wind components
* p5_CompileData-PerTrip-PerID_TableS1&S9.R: make table S1 and S9
* p6_Figure2&TablesS5-S6.R: make table S5 and S6
* p6_TableS2.R: make table S2
* p6a_TableS3_Long-diff-pops.R: make table S3
* p6b_TablesS7&8_WindSelectivity_glmms&posthoc.R: make table S7 and S8
* pt2pt_fxns.R: functions to compute distance, duration and speed

### Side scripts
These scripts are helper scripts automatically loaded when running the main scripts.
* sidescript_readSwedes.R: read Swedish dataset, make selection and manipulate data to match with mh-resampled-23092017
* sidescript_CalcDailyStats.R: compute daily statistics
* sidescript_CalcStopovers.R: compute coordinates and duration of stopovers
* sidescript_readDEM.R: read and manipulate DEM for making maps
